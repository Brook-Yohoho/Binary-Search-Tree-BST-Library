# Binary-Search-Tree-BST-Library

This repository contains a C library for working with binary search trees. The library provides essential functions for creating, manipulating, and managing BSTs. Below, Iâ€™ll explain the purpose of this library, its features, and how to use it.

# Features
The BST library includes the following functions:

Minimum: Returns the minimum value in the tree.
Maximum: Returns the maximum value in the tree.
Insert: Inserts a new value into the tree.
Search: Searches for a value in the tree.
Print: Prints the tree in order.
Free: Frees the memory used by the tree.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Compile the library using the provided Makefile.
Include the header file (bst.h) in your C programs.
Link your program with the compiled library.

# Usage
# Creating a BST

#include "bst.h"

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    BST* tree = bst_create();

    // Insert values into the tree
    bst_insert(tree, 5);
    bst_insert(tree, 3);
    // ... (insert other values)

    // Print the tree
    printf("Tree contents: ");
    bst_print(tree);

    // Find minimum and maximum
    printf("Minimum: %d\n", bst_minimum(tree));
    printf("Maximum: %d\n", bst_maximum(tree));

    // Search for a value
    int target = 5;
    if (bst_search(tree, target)) {
        printf("Found %d in the tree.\n", target);
    } else {
        printf("%d not found in the tree.\n", target);
    }

    // Free memory
    bst_free(tree);

    return 0;
}

# Deleting Nodes
To delete nodes from the tree, implement the transplant and delete functions. Then, test them using the example data provided.

# Organizing Vehicle Data
Organize the given CSV file of vehicle data into a balanced BST based on price. Implement a struct for vehicles and a comparison function to compare objects by price. Verify the correctness by printing the tree after reading all data from the file.

# Observations
Please record your observations about the organization of values in a text file named observations.txt.
